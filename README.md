Real Time Estimation for Driver Drowsiness Using Artificial Neural Network Models


Background: Car accidents are one of the most critical problems in society, which is why the search for solutions arises through different systems. Thus, automating existing procedures emerge as a great alternative, and this project is directed to answer this problem. Therefore, using convolutional artificial neural networks for training models is crucial in building this drowsiness detection system. It  will detect that a person's eyes are closed for more than a few seconds, and the system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.

Methods: In this paper, we propose the use of a CNN for computerized eye openness identification by employing in-real time images. The acquisition of the database was carried out through free access databases. A short program uses the trained CNN in order to classify the images obtained from a video recording of the device's camera. 
Results: As we modified the network training, different values were reported for validation accuracy, false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN), precision, and recall. Thus, having model I with a validation accuracy value of 93% for the two classes. Model II with a validation accuracy value of 99% for the two classes. Finally, Model III with a validation accuracy value of 99% for the two classes as well.

Conclusions: Our convolutional neural network proved to be a powerful tool to create eye openness detection systems having high accuracy values and being able to create an alarm system based on the alleged drowsiness by closeness of an individual's eyes.
